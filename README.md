## File Structure

```

└── README.md       # Project documentation (this file)
```

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   - Download the ZIP or clone the repo to your local machine.

2. **Open the Project**
   - Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the landing page.

3. **Customize**
   - Edit `index.html` and `style.css` to change content, colors, fonts, or layout as needed.

## Usage

- Update the navigation links in the header to match your site sections.
- Replace the hero section text and call-to-action button with your own content.
- Add or modify sections as needed for your business or personal needs.
- Update social media links in the footer.

## Mobile Menu

The navigation bar includes a mobile menu toggle button. The menu opens and closes on small screens for better usability. This is handled by a small JavaScript snippet at the bottom of `index.html`.

## Customization Tips

- **Fonts:** The template uses [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) from Google Fonts. You can change this in the `<head>` section of `index.html`.
- **Colors & Styles:** Modify `style.css` to adjust colors, spacing, and other visual elements.
- **Sections:** Add more sections (e.g., About, Services, Contact) by copying the structure in `index.html`.

## Browser Support

Tested on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari.
